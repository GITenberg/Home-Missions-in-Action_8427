description: This book is written from the standpoint of the words chosen as the key
  note for the year, "Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done on earth." It recognizes
  the fact that the Kingdom cannot come to our land, or to the world unless all social
  conditions are drawn within its scope; it emphasizes the desire of Home Missions
  and the church to work toward this great end, and the recognition of their responsibility
  for its accomplishment. That this book may reveal the far-reaching potentialities
  of Home Missions as a dynamic force for reclaiming, educating, healing, and integrating
  our nation into a land over which the Christ shall reign and that from Him it shall
  also draw its ideals and its power, is the hope and the prayer of the author and
  the Council of Women for Home Missions.
